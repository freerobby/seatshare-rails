## Contributing

A few guidelines to help make sure we don't step all over each other.

* We :heart: [TDD](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html).
* Open issues prior to starting work on a task (so feedback can be collected before you get too far along).
* Use the [GitHub Flow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html) method of managing branches/code changes.
** Start all work in a new branch created off the tip of master
** Commit work to that branch (e.g. `feature/189-new-emails`)
** Squash commits into a single commit prior to pushing.
** Push to the same named branch on GitHub.
** Open a Pull Request describing the desired outcome of merging the branch back into master and referencing the previously created issue(s) it closes.
* Wait for a :+1: (or equivilant) before merging -- unless the code review stays dormant for more than a day or two.
* Repeat the process until excellent.
